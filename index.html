      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Jack Morgan, and I am a Unity Developer and Gameplay Programmer
        with experience across PC, VR, and console platforms. I graduated with
        First Class Honours in Computer Science from the University of Wolverhampton,
        where I worked on projects such as <em>Hazard Perception VR</em>, an educational
        application designed to teach learner drivers how to spot potential road hazards
        through immersive VR training.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also developed <em>Mechanical Revelation</em>, my first complete game, which
        focused on creating advanced AI with intelligent pathfinding and enemy detection
        mechanics. This project allowed me to explore systems like waypoint navigation,
        player detection, and responsive enemy behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since completing my dissertation, Iâ€™ve taken on the role of Lead Programmer
        at Cosmic Sabbath, working on an upcoming horror title. My responsibilities
        include developing core gameplay mechanics, UI systems, audio programming,
        and more. This role has strengthened my ability to collaborate in a team
        environment and refine my technical and creative skills.

      <h2>Why Unity Development and Gameplay Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for Unity Development comes from a lifelong love of games and a
        curiosity about how they are built. Growing up as a gamer, I was fascinated
        by the different ways games create unique experiences. This led me to found
        <em>Opsters eSports</em>, a gaming community and competitive team, where I
        gained valuable insight into how players engage with games and what makes
        them enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        At university, I chose a Game Development module, where I discovered how
        much I enjoyed designing and programming interactive experiences. With my
        strong Computer Science background, I quickly realised that gameplay
        programming was where I could combine my technical skills with my creativity.
        Developing systems that drive player interaction such as puzzles, mechanics,
        and dynamic behaviours which are something I find both challenging and rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, the real joy of gameplay programming is in bringing ideas to life.
        Creating mechanics that feel engaging, polished, and meaningful gives players
        a deeper connection to the game, and that sense of impact is what motivates
        me to keep building and improving.
